# Advent of code 2023

I will attempt to get all 50⭐️ for this year

## Setup

I will solve the days using:

- Typescript and Deno

You can install deno form the [Deno installation page]

## Running the tests

You can run the tests for a specific day by using the command:

```sh
deno test day_xx
```

And to run the test in watch mode:

```sh
deno test day_xx --watch
```

To run the full test suite:

```sh
deno test
```

## Getting the solutions

To run the solution you will need to download the inputs specific to your
account. Each input should be stored in the day folder inside a file called
`input.txt` you should not share you inputs publically (notice that these files
are excluded in the `.gitignore`).

```sh
deno run --allow-read day_xx/main.ts
```
